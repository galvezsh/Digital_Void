    docsHomelabContent_1: "<p>If you're here, it's because you're interested in <strong>building your own home server</strong>, mainly with <strong>Intel processors</strong>, although I will also mention <strong>AMD</strong> alternatives to set up your home server.</p><p>In the following sections, we will see <strong>what options and alternatives exist</strong>, and most importantly: <strong>understand from scratch</strong> the basics and the knowledge needed to achieve it, since <strong>I did it knowing practically nothing about the topic</strong>, making mistakes. Now I'm here to inform you and help you <strong>avoid those same mistakes</strong>. So, without further ado, let's begin.</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_2: "<p>Now that we know what this is about, let‚Äôs start with the basics: <strong>what do you need?</strong> You should be aware that <strong>setting up a home server can be costly</strong>, with prices ranging from <strong‚Ç¨300 to over ‚Ç¨1000</strong>, so it‚Äôs important to <strong>define your needs clearly</strong>.</p><p>There are two ways to set up your own server: you can choose a <strong>prebuilt brand NAS</strong>, such as <strong>Synology, QNAP, or Asustor</strong>, or <strong>build a custom one</strong> by assembling the parts yourself. Both options have <strong>advantages and disadvantages</strong>, and the choice will depend on your specific needs.</p><p>If you‚Äôre looking for <strong>simplicity</strong> and have a <strong>tight budget</strong>, the most recommended option is to go with a <strong>brand NAS</strong>. These NAS devices are designed for those who want a <strong>small home server</strong> for <strong>occasional movie watching</strong>, <strong>storing photos, videos, and documents</strong> without dealing with the physical assembly. Although <strong>they‚Äôre not the cheapest option</strong>, they are <em>plug and play</em>: <strong>just power them on</strong>, and in less than half an hour you‚Äôll have a <strong>fully functional server</strong>, even with <strong>redundancy options for extra safety</strong>.</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_3: "<p>If you're someone who likes to <strong>tinker</strong> or need something more <strong>personalized</strong>, a <strong>custom server is for you</strong>; it's ideal if you have a <strong>large movie library</strong>, need <strong>power to handle heavy files</strong>, want to <strong>run virtual machines</strong>, set up a <strong>game server</strong>, or deploy <strong>specific services for personal projects</strong>.</p><p>Although a custom server <strong>requires more initial work</strong>, it is usually <strong>more economical in the long run</strong> than a pre-built one, and it is also <strong>more scalable</strong>, as you can <strong>add or upgrade components</strong> as needed, something not so easy with <strong>brand servers</strong>, whose <strong>upgrade capacity is limited</strong>.</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_4: "<p>As a personal recommendation, I want to clarify that it‚Äôs <strong>hard to define exactly how much you should invest in your server</strong>, since this mainly depends on the <strong>amount and type of data</strong> you want to store.</p><p>In fact, the <strong>basic hardware (processor, motherboard, and RAM)</strong> can be quite affordable, especially if you know <strong>where to look for second-hand components</strong>. This way, you can get a <strong>powerful and durable system</strong> with a low initial investment.</p><p>Undoubtedly, the most expensive parts will be the <strong>hard drives</strong>. My recommendation is to buy them <strong>new</strong>, or if you choose <strong>second-hand</strong> drives, check their condition carefully by reviewing the <strong>SMART data</strong> to ensure they have <strong>very few hours of use</strong>. Remember, drives are the most critical part of a NAS, and a failure can mean <strong>loss of valuable data</strong>.</p><p>Regarding capacity, the ideal is to invest in <strong>drives of 4 TB or more</strong>. This way, you <strong>make better use of space</strong> and <strong>need fewer drives to store the same amount of data</strong>. This not only simplifies the setup of <strong>RAID systems</strong> but also <strong>reduces power consumption</strong> by having fewer drives running, making it more efficient and cost-effective in the long run.</p><p>Another very important aspect is the <strong>power supply</strong>. A low-quality PSU can <strong>deliver unstable voltages</strong>, lack protections against power surges, and even <strong>fail to provide the promised power</strong>. This not only puts your hardware at risk but can also lead to <strong>serious failures or irreversible damage</strong>. Therefore, it‚Äôs crucial to invest in a <strong>high-quality, certified power supply</strong>.</p><p>In conclusion, you shouldn‚Äôt worry too much about the <strong>processor, motherboard, or RAM</strong>, since these components are easy to obtain at reasonable prices. What really matters is having a <strong>reliable power supply</strong> and <strong>quality hard drives</strong>, because in the end, <strong>hardware can always be replaced, but your data cannot</strong>.</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_5: "<p>In my personal experience, I usually recommend <strong>Intel processors over AMD for servers</strong>. This doesn‚Äôt mean that AMD isn‚Äôt a good option ‚Äîin fact, it has improved a lot in recent years‚Äî but there are several reasons why I believe <strong>Intel offers important advantages</strong>, especially for home server setups.</p><p>The first reason is <strong>extended Linux support</strong>. From the beginning, Intel has been the dominant standard and has always had <strong>better compatibility and stability</strong> on Linux systems, both from major companies and the community. While AMD has made great progress in this area, Intel still maintains a slight edge.</p><p>The second reason is <strong>energy efficiency at idle</strong>. Intel processors have more <strong>C-States</strong> than AMD, allowing them to enter much deeper low-power modes. On my own server, the processor can consume <strong>less than 1 watt at idle</strong>, which is fantastic for a machine running <strong>24/7</strong>.</p><p>The third reason is <strong>connectivity thanks to PCI Express</strong>. I use a <strong>12th generation (Alder Lake) Intel processor</strong> with support for <strong>PCIe 5.0</strong>. This is crucial because each new PCIe version not only increases speed but also <strong>doubles the equivalent number of lanes</strong>. For example, <strong>a single PCIe 3.0 lane is equivalent in bandwidth to two PCIe 2.0 lanes</strong>. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs recommended to have <strong>many available lanes</strong> or a <strong>high PCIe version</strong>, as it translates into <strong>more devices and greater flexibility</strong> without limiting performance.</p><p>The fourth reason is the <strong>integrated graphics</strong>. Intel processors include <strong>Intel Quick Sync</strong>, a video transcoding technology that makes a huge difference in <strong>media servers</strong>. Thanks to it, movie playback and conversion is <strong>much more efficient</strong> than with AMD‚Äôs integrated solutions. However, this <strong>does not apply to Intel models with the ‚ÄúF‚Äù suffix</strong> (nor AMD processors without integrated graphics), as in those cases <strong>you cannot output video from the motherboard ports</strong>. This means you will need to manage everything <strong>remotely</strong> or temporarily add a dedicated graphics card if you require local video output.</p><p>In summary, my recommendation is based on these four reasons: <strong>better Linux support, lower idle power consumption, more flexibility with PCIe, and the advantage of Quick Sync</strong>. That said, the final choice will always depend on your needs and preferences, and AMD can still be a good alternative in many scenarios.</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_6: "<p>Now that you more or less know what you want or need, let's see what you should know before you start buying your server components; this mainly applies to custom servers, but is also useful for pre-built servers.</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_7: "<p><strong>Let‚Äôs start with hard drives</strong>. Beyond the technical details, what really matters is understanding the <strong>recording technologies</strong> they use to store data. In <strong>mechanical drives</strong>, information is stored <strong>magnetically</strong>, and there are two main methods.</p><p>The most common ones are <strong>CMR</strong> (*Conventional Magnetic Recording*) and <strong>SMR</strong> (*Shingled Magnetic Recording*). There is also <strong>PMR</strong>, but it‚Äôs basically the same as CMR. The difference is simple: <strong>CMR</strong> writes on <strong>separate tracks</strong>, while <strong>SMR</strong> writes on <strong>partially overlapping tracks</strong>.</p><p>In SMR, the tracks are arranged like <strong>roof shingles</strong>. This means that if you want to modify data, the drive must <strong>erase and rewrite multiple tracks</strong>, unlike CMR where the head accesses each track directly.</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_8: "<p>This difference makes <strong>CMR</strong> much more <strong>fast and efficient</strong>, since it allows writing and rewriting without extra steps. In contrast, <strong>SMR</strong> is <strong>slower</strong> in random write tasks because it needs to <strong>erase and rewrite overlapping tracks</strong> before recording new data.</p><p>Therefore, the <strong>main drawback of SMR</strong> is its lower performance in intensive write workloads. However, for <strong>sequential workloads</strong> ‚Äîsuch as <strong>storing movies, backups, or rarely modified data</strong>‚Äî it can be a <strong>cheaper option</strong>. For instance, I bought <strong>4 SMR 4 TB drives</strong> for <strong‚Ç¨100 each</strong>, while the equivalent <strong>CMR</strong> drives cost around <strong‚Ç¨150‚Äì160 each</strong>.</p><p>My <strong>personal recommendation</strong> is to always choose <strong>CMR</strong> for its <strong>better performance and versatility</strong>. Still, if you find <strong>SMR at a very good price</strong> and you know you‚Äôll use them for <strong>mostly static storage</strong> (multimedia, backups, etc.), they can be a <strong>valid alternative</strong>.</p><p>Besides the recording technology, the <strong>internal medium</strong> also matters: some drives are sealed with <strong>air</strong> (the same mix we breathe), while others are filled with <strong>helium</strong>. Helium is used in high-capacity drives (usually 8 TB or more) because it <strong>reduces friction, allows more platters in the same space, and improves cooling</strong>. The problem is that <strong>helium eventually leaks</strong>, since it‚Äôs the second smallest element in the periodic table. In practice, helium drives often <strong>fail after just a few years</strong>, typically right after the warranty expires (3‚Äì5 years). Therefore, unless you specifically need very high capacity and can manage replacements carefully, I <strong>do not recommend helium-filled drives</strong> for a home server.</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_9: "<p><strong>SSDs (solid-state drives)</strong> are a <strong>relatively new technology</strong> compared to traditional mechanical hard drives; although most people only focus on the <strong>sequential read and write speeds</strong> manufacturers advertise, there are <strong>many other factors that influence the real performance and quality</strong> of an SSD.</p><p>Besides sequential speeds, you must consider the <strong>random read and write speeds</strong>, which are especially important for the <strong>daily use of the operating system and applications</strong>; it is also essential to know if the SSD includes <strong>cache memory (DRAM or HMB)</strong>, its <strong>durability (TBW, terabytes written)</strong>, the type of <strong>controller</strong> it integrates, and of course, the <strong>type of memory chip</strong> it uses to store data.</p><p>In this regard, the <strong>type of chip greatly influences the performance, reliability, and lifespan</strong> of the SSD: there are technologies such as <strong>SLC</strong> (faster and more durable), <strong>MLC</strong>, <strong>TLC</strong>, and <strong>QLC</strong> (more economical but less resistant); also, <strong>the company that manufactures these chips also matters</strong>, and a notable case is <strong>YMTC</strong>, a Chinese manufacturer that has surpassed leading brands using a patented technology called <strong>Xtacking 3.0</strong>, which allows <strong>higher speeds and efficiency</strong> thanks to an innovative architecture that <strong>separates logic and memory into two independent layers</strong>; currently, the <strong>most recommended option for value-for-money</strong> are <strong>TLC chips</strong>, especially the <strong>232-layer YMTC models</strong>, which in my tests have not only outperformed much of the competition but also <strong>run at lower temperatures</strong> and offer <strong>surprising durability</strong>, <strong>tripling the manufacturer‚Äôs estimated lifespan</strong> and remaining fully operational, <strong>something crucial in servers where reliability is an absolute priority</strong>.</p><p>I leave here a couple of <strong>videos</strong> where all the points I mentioned earlier are explained. The video is exclusively in <strong>Spanish</strong>, although you can <strong>activate subtitles</strong> if you need them:</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_10: "<p>In many setups, especially home servers or PCs intended for storage, you may need to connect more SATA drives than your motherboard allows by default; for these cases there are <strong>PCI-Express to SATA adapters</strong> that allow you to add more SATA ports by using a free PCIe slot.</p><p>These adapters generally connect to a <strong>PCI-Express 3.0 x1</strong> port, which has an important bandwidth limitation: this type of connection offers a <strong>maximum theoretical speed of about 985 MB/s (8 Gbps)</strong>, which must be shared among all the SATA ports the card has.</p>",    
    docsHomelabContent_11: "<p>To put it into perspective, a drive connected to a <strong>SATA III port (6 Gbps)</strong> can reach speeds of up to <strong>550‚Äì600 MB/s</strong>; therefore, if you use a <strong>PCIe 3.0 x1 adapter with 4 SATA ports</strong>, those theoretical 985 MB/s will be shared among all drives, meaning that if you access all four at once, <strong>each could be limited to just over 240 MB/s</strong>, or even less under real conditions.</p><p>On the other hand, the <strong>SATA connectors integrated into the motherboard</strong> are usually better optimized: manufacturers connect them directly to the chipset or the processor‚Äôs controller, ensuring that <strong>each port has its full bandwidth</strong>, which is crucial for demanding setups or fast drives.</p><p>That‚Äôs why, although PCIe to SATA adapters are useful, it‚Äôs essential to keep in mind <strong>their speed limitation</strong>, especially if you plan to use them with multiple SSDs or need <strong>high sustained performance</strong>; for less demanding tasks ‚Äîsuch as backups or multimedia storage‚Äî <strong>they can be a perfectly valid solution</strong>.</p><p>So, if you were considering buying one of these adapters, make sure to check both the <strong>PCIe interface</strong> it uses and the <strong>controller chip</strong> it incorporates; most use <strong>ASMedia controllers</strong>, and knowing the exact model (for example, <strong>ASM1061 or ASM1166</strong>) will help you anticipate performance. There are also versions with <strong>PCIe x4 connectors</strong> that allow greater bandwidth, although these are less common and more expensive.</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_12: "<p>The <strong>motherboard</strong> is, without a doubt, the <strong>backbone of any server</strong>; knowing it well is the most important thing you can do, since absolutely everything connects to it. If for some reason the motherboard is poorly designed or has connectivity or performance shortcomings, <strong>it will be the first and biggest bottleneck</strong> in your server.</p><p>The best advice before buying a motherboard is to <strong>carefully read the manual provided by the manufacturer</strong>; it details how the <strong>internal bandwidth</strong> is distributed and transmitted, which ports connect to the chipset, which go directly to the processor, and what physical or technical limitations the motherboard has.</p><p>In a server, <strong>connectivity and expandability are key</strong>. If the motherboard‚Äôs <strong>chipset</strong> does not provide enough bandwidth for all available ports, a quite common phenomenon occurs in budget boards: <strong>some connections are disabled or their speed reduced when others are in use</strong>, causing performance or compatibility issues.</p><p>A typical example of this happens with <strong>M.2 ports</strong> for SSDs: many motherboards include two M.2 connectors, but only one ‚Äîusually the upper one‚Äî <strong>runs at full speed</strong>, while the second shares bandwidth with <strong>SATA ports</strong>; in these setups, <strong>if you use the second M.2, you may lose one or more SATA ports</strong>, since the system disables one to enable the other automatically.</p><p>This type of situation usually occurs on <strong>more affordable motherboards</strong> that use chipsets limited in PCIe lanes and other interfaces. Although at first glance they seem to have many connections, <strong>not all work simultaneously at maximum performance</strong>. This can go unnoticed at first but becomes a serious problem when you need to expand your server.</p>",
    docsHomelabContent_13: "<p>In these two images, you can see how the PCI-Express lanes are distributed from the processor to the chipset, how the configurations change between different chipset tiers, and how manufacturers play with the options the processor allows. <strong>Usually, a higher-end chipset includes more connectivity</strong>, making it ideal for a server where you want to connect many devices.</p><p>For all these reasons, choosing an <strong>appropriate motherboard is probably the most critical decision when building a server</strong>. It‚Äôs better to invest a little more in a board with a <strong>better chipset, greater connectivity, and more expansion support</strong> that allows you to grow without having to replace the entire system in the future.</p>"
