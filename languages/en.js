    docsRyzenContent_1: "<p>If you're here, it's because you're interested in <strong>building your own home server</strong>, mainly with <strong>Ryzen processors</strong>, although I will also mention <strong>Intel</strong> alternatives to set up your home server.</p><p>In the following sections, we will see <strong>what options and alternatives exist</strong>, and most importantly: <strong>understand from scratch</strong> the basics and the knowledge needed to achieve it, since <strong>I did it knowing practically nothing about the topic</strong>, making mistakes. Now I'm here to inform you and help you <strong>avoid those same mistakes</strong>. So, without further ado, let's begin.</p>",
    docsRyzenContent_2: "<p>Now that we know what this is about, let's start with the basics: <strong>what do you need?</strong> You should be aware that <strong>building a home server can be costly</strong>, with prices ranging from <strong>‚Ç¨300 to over ‚Ç¨1000</strong>, so it's important to <strong>clearly define your needs</strong>.</p><p>There are two ways to set up your own server: you can opt for a <strong>pre-built brand-name one</strong>, like <strong>Synology, QNAP, or Asustor</strong>, or <strong>build a custom one</strong> by assembling the parts yourself from scratch; both options have <strong>advantages and disadvantages</strong>, and the choice depends on your specific needs. Let's see an example to understand it better.</p><p>Imagine you are not willing to spend much money because you only want a <strong>home server to occasionally watch movies</strong>, <strong>store photos, videos, or documents</strong>, and access them from your computer, without complicating yourself with the physical assembly.</p><p>If you seek <strong>simplicity</strong> and have a <strong>tight budget</strong>, you can choose a brand server like <strong>Synology, QNAP, or Asustor</strong>; although <strong>they are not the cheapest option</strong>, they are <em>plug and play</em>: <strong>just turn them on</strong> and in less than half an hour you'll have a <strong>functional server</strong>, even with <strong>redundancy options for greater security</strong>.</p>",
    docsRyzenContent_3: "<p>If you're someone who likes to <strong>tinker</strong> or need something more <strong>personalized</strong>, a <strong>custom server is for you</strong>; it's ideal if you have a <strong>large movie library</strong>, need <strong>power to handle heavy files</strong>, want to <strong>run virtual machines</strong>, set up a <strong>game server</strong>, or deploy <strong>specific services for personal projects</strong>.</p><p>Although a custom server <strong>requires more initial work</strong>, it is usually <strong>more economical in the long run</strong> than a pre-built one, and it is also <strong>more scalable</strong>, as you can <strong>add or upgrade components</strong> as needed, something not so easy with <strong>brand servers</strong>, whose <strong>upgrade capacity is limited</strong>.</p>",
    docsRyzenContent_4: "<p>I understand you may have doubts about <strong>how much you should invest in your server</strong>, so I will give you a series of <strong>steps and recommendations</strong> to guide you better.</p><p>If you want to <strong>spend little money but have something decent</strong>, personalized and durable, with <strong>upgrade possibilities</strong>, the most advisable is to opt for <strong>second-hand components</strong>, as technology <strong>depreciates quickly</strong> over time.</p><p>For example, a system with an <strong>Intel Core i5 or i7 processor of eighth or ninth generation</strong> or any <strong>Ryzen</strong> can be <strong>more than enough for your current needs</strong> and even for some advanced uses in the future; with at least <strong>4 physical cores, 8‚ÄØGB of RAM, 128‚ÄØGB SSD</strong>, and a <strong>450 W certified power supply</strong>, you already have a <strong>solid base to start</strong>, with upgrade capacity and a very tight cost.</p>",
    docsRyzenContent_5: "<p>Now that you more or less know what you want or need, let's see what you should know before you start buying your server components; this mainly applies to custom servers, but is also useful for pre-built servers.</p>",
    docsRyzenContent_6: "<p><strong>Let's start with hard drives</strong>: it's no surprise they have been around for a long time, and on the Internet you can find more technical explanations, but here I will focus on the <strong>technologies they use to internally record information</strong>, without going into too much detail; in <strong>mechanical hard drives</strong>, information is stored <strong>magnetically</strong>, and there are different technologies that vary the way data is written.</p><p>There are two main <strong>data recording technologies</strong>: <strong>CMR</strong> and <strong>SMR</strong>; there is also <strong>PMR</strong>, but it's practically the same as CMR, so we won't go into details; <strong>CMR</strong> (*Conventional Magnetic Recording*) records data on <strong>non-overlapping tracks</strong>, while <strong>SMR</strong> (*Shingled Magnetic Recording*) does so on <strong>partially overlapping tracks</strong>.</p><p>The overlapping in SMR is organized like <strong>roof shingles</strong>, which changes how data is written: in <strong>CMR</strong>, the read/write head accesses each track directly, but in <strong>SMR</strong>, if you need to modify a track, you must first <strong>ERASE</strong> and <strong>REWRITE</strong> all the overlapping tracks with it.</p>",

    docsRyzenContent_7: "<p>This creates a <strong>significant difference between both technologies</strong>: in <strong>CMR</strong> you can write, erase, and rewrite information <strong>quickly and efficiently</strong>, since the write head accesses each track directly, while in <strong>SMR</strong>, if you need to modify data, the process is <strong>slower</strong> because the disk must <strong>erase and rewrite several overlapping tracks</strong> before writing the new information; <strong>this additional process can significantly reduce write speed, especially in random write operations</strong>.</p><p>Therefore, the <strong>main disadvantage of SMR</strong> is its <strong>low performance</strong> in intensive random write tasks; <strong>however, for mostly sequential workloads ‚Äîsuch as storing movies or rarely modified data‚Äî it can be a viable and more economical option</strong>, especially if you get good prices, as was my case: I bought 4 <strong>Western Digital Red</strong> drives for only <strong>‚Ç¨400 (‚Ç¨100 each)</strong>, compared to the 4 TB <strong>CMR</strong> drives that cost between <strong>‚Ç¨150 and ‚Ç¨160 each</strong>.</p><p>My <strong>personal recommendation</strong> is that, if you haven't bought the <strong>mechanical hard drives</strong> yet, you <strong>go directly for CMR</strong>, since they offer <strong>better performance and greater flexibility</strong> for different uses; however, if you find <strong>SMR drives at a very good price</strong>, as was my case, they can be a <strong>valid option</strong>, but only if you are sure you will use them to <strong>store data that is not frequently modified</strong>, such as <strong>backups or multimedia content</strong> (movies, series, etc.).</p>",
    docsRyzenContent_8: "<p><strong>SSDs (solid-state drives)</strong> are a <strong>relatively new technology</strong> compared to traditional mechanical hard drives; although most people only focus on the <strong>sequential read and write speeds</strong> manufacturers advertise, there are <strong>many other factors that influence the real performance and quality</strong> of an SSD.</p><p>Besides sequential speeds, you must consider the <strong>random read and write speeds</strong>, which are especially important for the <strong>daily use of the operating system and applications</strong>; it is also essential to know if the SSD includes <strong>cache memory (DRAM or HMB)</strong>, its <strong>durability (TBW, terabytes written)</strong>, the type of <strong>controller</strong> it integrates, and of course, the <strong>type of memory chip</strong> it uses to store data.</p><p>In this regard, the <strong>type of chip greatly influences the performance, reliability, and lifespan</strong> of the SSD: there are technologies such as <strong>SLC</strong> (faster and more durable), <strong>MLC</strong>, <strong>TLC</strong>, and <strong>QLC</strong> (more economical but less resistant); also, <strong>the company that manufactures these chips also matters</strong>, and a notable case is <strong>YMTC</strong>, a Chinese manufacturer that has surpassed leading brands using a patented technology called <strong>Xtacking 3.0</strong>, which allows <strong>higher speeds and efficiency</strong> thanks to an innovative architecture that <strong>separates logic and memory into two independent layers</strong>; currently, the <strong>most recommended option for value-for-money</strong> are <strong>TLC chips</strong>, especially the <strong>232-layer YMTC models</strong>, which in my tests have not only outperformed much of the competition but also <strong>run at lower temperatures</strong> and offer <strong>surprising durability</strong>, <strong>tripling the manufacturer‚Äôs estimated lifespan</strong> and remaining fully operational, <strong>something crucial in servers where reliability is an absolute priority</strong>.</p><p>I leave here a couple of <strong>videos</strong> where all the points I mentioned earlier are explained. The video is exclusively in <strong>Spanish</strong>, although you can <strong>activate subtitles</strong> if you need them:</p>",
    docsRyzenContent_9: "<p>In many setups, especially home servers or PCs intended for storage, you may need to connect more SATA drives than your motherboard allows by default; for these cases there are <strong>PCI-Express to SATA adapters</strong> that allow you to add more SATA ports by using a free PCIe slot.</p><p>These adapters generally connect to a <strong>PCI-Express 3.0 x1</strong> port, which has an important bandwidth limitation: this type of connection offers a <strong>maximum theoretical speed of about 985 MB/s (8 Gbps)</strong>, which must be shared among all the SATA ports the card has.</p>",    
    docsRyzenContent_10: "<p>To put it into perspective, a drive connected to a <strong>SATA III port (6 Gbps)</strong> can reach speeds of up to <strong>550‚Äì600 MB/s</strong>; therefore, if you use a <strong>PCIe 3.0 x1 adapter with 4 SATA ports</strong>, those theoretical 985 MB/s will be shared among all drives, meaning that if you access all four at once, <strong>each could be limited to just over 240 MB/s</strong>, or even less under real conditions.</p><p>On the other hand, the <strong>SATA connectors integrated into the motherboard</strong> are usually better optimized: manufacturers connect them directly to the chipset or the processor‚Äôs controller, ensuring that <strong>each port has its full bandwidth</strong>, which is crucial for demanding setups or fast drives.</p><p>That‚Äôs why, although PCIe to SATA adapters are useful, it‚Äôs essential to keep in mind <strong>their speed limitation</strong>, especially if you plan to use them with multiple SSDs or need <strong>high sustained performance</strong>; for less demanding tasks ‚Äîsuch as backups or multimedia storage‚Äî <strong>they can be a perfectly valid solution</strong>.</p><p>So, if you were considering buying one of these adapters, make sure to check both the <strong>PCIe interface</strong> it uses and the <strong>controller chip</strong> it incorporates; most use <strong>ASMedia controllers</strong>, and knowing the exact model (for example, <strong>ASM1061 or ASM1166</strong>) will help you anticipate performance. There are also versions with <strong>PCIe x4 connectors</strong> that allow greater bandwidth, although these are less common and more expensive.</p>",
    docsRyzenContent_11: "<p>The <strong>motherboard</strong> is, without a doubt, the <strong>backbone of any server</strong>; knowing it well is the most important thing you can do, since absolutely everything connects to it. If for some reason the motherboard is poorly designed or has connectivity or performance shortcomings, <strong>it will be the first and biggest bottleneck</strong> in your server.</p><p>The best advice before buying a motherboard is to <strong>carefully read the manual provided by the manufacturer</strong>; it details how the <strong>internal bandwidth</strong> is distributed and transmitted, which ports connect to the chipset, which go directly to the processor, and what physical or technical limitations the motherboard has.</p><p>In a server, <strong>connectivity and expandability are key</strong>. If the motherboard‚Äôs <strong>chipset</strong> does not provide enough bandwidth for all available ports, a quite common phenomenon occurs in budget boards: <strong>some connections are disabled or their speed reduced when others are in use</strong>, causing performance or compatibility issues.</p><p>A typical example of this happens with <strong>M.2 ports</strong> for SSDs: many motherboards include two M.2 connectors, but only one ‚Äîusually the upper one‚Äî <strong>runs at full speed</strong>, while the second shares bandwidth with <strong>SATA ports</strong>; in these setups, <strong>if you use the second M.2, you may lose one or more SATA ports</strong>, since the system disables one to enable the other automatically.</p><p>This type of situation usually occurs on <strong>more affordable motherboards</strong> that use chipsets limited in PCIe lanes and other interfaces. Although at first glance they seem to have many connections, <strong>not all work simultaneously at maximum performance</strong>. This can go unnoticed at first but becomes a serious problem when you need to expand your server.</p>",
    docsRyzenContent_12: "<p>In these two images, you can see how the PCI-Express lanes are distributed from the processor to the chipset, how the configurations change between different chipset tiers, and how manufacturers play with the options the processor allows. <strong>Usually, a higher-end chipset includes more connectivity</strong>, making it ideal for a server where you want to connect many devices.</p><p>For all these reasons, choosing an <strong>appropriate motherboard is probably the most critical decision when building a server</strong>. It‚Äôs better to invest a little more in a board with a <strong>better chipset, greater connectivity, and more expansion support</strong> that allows you to grow without having to replace the entire system in the future.</p>"
